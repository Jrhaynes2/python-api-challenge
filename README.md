Module 6 Challenge


**I leaned heavily on the Xpert learning assistant and ChatGPT for help with the code because I could NOT get the API to pull cities correctly. It kept saying "City not found. Skipping..." even though the cities WERE there. I could not solve this for the life of me and I've stopped trying... I'm not sure if the code works in the WeatherPy because the API step would not pull in. I'm just posting what I got assistance with and hoping that is correct. I just don't want to miss too many assignments and will take what I can get here.
